RELEASE NOTES:
==============


  DONE: Fixed reset button stop working after first form submit in form facility.


"version": "1.2.3" - Bluebird promise engine, better form facility experience and more...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  DONE: Modifyed request mapper to get url parameters "as is":
    - i.e.: "/foo/:section/bar/:id" will generate ':section' and ':id' vectors in service handler input.

  DONE: Fixed facilities breaking when using url parameters by using serviceName instead of actual path. So:
    - «"foo/:bar": {_get:...}» will be broken anyway.
    - «"foo": {path:"foo/:bar",_get:...}»:
      º Service facilities will be attached to foo/facility_name (BUT OVERRIDDEN in this case).
      º Root facility will be attached normally to /facility_name.
      º foo/facility_name overridding could be avoided thought below parameters:
        · "noOverride<FacName>" (noOverrideHelp, noOverrideForm, etc...)
        · "noOverrideAllFacilities" to avoid overridding any facility.

  DONE: Changed all "noOverrideXXX" with equivalent "allowOverrideXXX", reversing logic and defaulting to true.
    - This will be more consistent with future "allow(Filters)Override..." preferences.

  DONE: Implemented simetric "allowXXXFilterOverride" and "allowAllFiltersOverride" preferences for the same purpose.
    - All defaults to false meaning that available filters are not overridable by routes.

  DONE: Accept array as path parameter to deploy same service over multiple urls.
    - Example: ["/foo/bar", "/foo/bar/:id]

  NOTE: Form facility now uses first defined path of any service by default. I think that allowing to select from each has no point except if interpolating fields to fill url parameters. Which is too much complicated compared in simply send colon-prefixed parameters in normal request which will have the same effect at least when using current default requestMapper.

  DONE: Moved to bluebird as core promise engine.
